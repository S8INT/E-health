E-Health API for Medical Image Processing ðŸ“¡
Overview

The E-Health API is designed to process medical images from various imaging machines, such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. This API supports uploading and basic preprocessing of medical images in formats such as DICOM, PNG, JPEG, etc. It also serves as a base for integrating advanced AI/ML models for medical image analysis and diagnosis.
Features:

    Upload medical images (DICOM, PNG, JPG).
    Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, normalization).
    Placeholder for deep learning model inference (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch-based models).
    Secure API endpoints for image processing.

Key Technologies:

    Flask: Lightweight Python web framework.
    OpenCV: Powerful computer vision library for image preprocessing.
    pydicom: Library to handle medical images in DICOM format.

Getting Started
Installation

# Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/ehealth-api.git
  cd E-health

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the API

    Run the Flask API:

    bash

    python app.py

    The server will start running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

API Endpoints
1. Upload an Image

    Endpoint: /upload
    Method: POST
    Description: Uploads a medical image to the server.

2. Process an Uploaded Image

    Endpoint: /process/<filename>
    Method: GET
    Description: Processes an uploaded image (grayscale, resize, etc.).

3. Image Inference (Placeholder)

    Endpoint: /inference
    Method: POST
    Description: Run AI/ML model inference on an image.
